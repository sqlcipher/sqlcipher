## SQLCipher

SQLCipher is an SQLite extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of 
database files. Pages are encrypted before being written to disk and are decrypted 
when read back. Due to the small footprint and great performance itâ€™s ideal for 
protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile development.

The official SQLCipher software site is http://sqlcipher.net

SQLCipher was initially developed by Stephen Lombardo at Zetetic LLC 
(sjlombardo@zetetic.net) as the encrypted database layer for Strip, 
an iPhone data vault and password manager (http://getstrip.com).   

## Features

- Fast performance with as little as 5-15% overhead for encryption on many operations
- 100% of data in the database file is encrypted
- Good security practices (CBC mode, key derivation)
- Zero-configuration and application level cryptography
- Algorithms provided by the peer reviewed OpenSSL crypto library.
- Configurable crypto providers

## Contributions

We welcome contributions, to contribute to SQLCipher, a [contributor agreement](https://www.zetetic.net/contributions/) needs to be submitted.  All submissions should be based on the `prerelease` branch.

## Compiling

Building SQLCipher is almost the same as compiling a regular version of 
SQLite with two small exceptions: 

 1. You *must* define SQLITE_HAS_CODEC and SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=2 when building sqlcipher. 
 2. You need to link against a OpenSSL's libcrypto 
 
Example Static linking (replace /opt/local/lib with the path to libcrypto.a). Note in this 
example, --enable-tempstore=yes is setting SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=2 for the build.

	$ ./configure --enable-tempstore=yes CFLAGS="-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC" \
		LDFLAGS="/opt/local/lib/libcrypto.a"
	$ make

Example Dynamic linking

	$ ./configure --enable-tempstore=yes CFLAGS="-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC" \
		LDFLAGS="-lcrypto"
	$ make

## Encrypting a database

To specify an encryption passphrase for the database via the SQL interface you 
use a pragma. The passphrase you enter is passed through PBKDF2 key derivation to
obtain the encryption key for the database 

	PRAGMA key = 'passphrase';

Alternately, you can specify an exact byte sequence using a blob literal. If you
use this method it is your responsibility to ensure that the data you provide a
64 character hex string, which will be converted directly to 32 bytes (256 bits) of 
key data without key derivation.

	PRAGMA key = "x'2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99'";

To encrypt a database programatically you can use the sqlite3_key function. 
The data provided in pKey is converted to an encryption key according to the 
same rules as PRAGMA key. 

	int sqlite3_key(sqlite3 *db, const void *pKey, int nKey);

PRAGMA key or sqlite3_key should be called as the first operation when a database is open.

## Changing a database key

To change the encryption passphrase for an existing database you may use the rekey pragma
after you've supplied the correct database password;

	PRAGMA key = 'passphrase'; -- start with the existing database passphrase
	PRAGMA rekey = 'new-passphrase'; -- rekey will reencrypt with the new passphrase

The hexrekey pragma may be used to rekey to a specific binary value

	PRAGMA rekey = "x'2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99'";

This can be accomplished programtically by using sqlite3_rekey;
  
	sqlite3_rekey(sqlite3 *db, const void *pKey, int nKey)

  SQLite: An Embeddable SQL Database Engine

To compile the project, first create a directory in which to place
the build products.  It is recommended, but not required, that the
build directory be separate from the source directory.  Cd into the
build directory and then from the build directory run the configure
script found at the root of the source tree.  Then run "make".

For example:

	tar xzf sqlite.tar.gz    ;#  Unpack the source tree into "sqlite"
    mkdir bld                ;#  Build will occur in a sibling directory
    cd bld                   ;#  Change to the build directory
    ../sqlite/configure      ;#  Run the configure script
    make                     ;#  Run the makefile.
    make install             ;#  (Optional) Install the build products

The configure script uses autoconf 2.61 and libtool.  If the configure
script does not work out for you, there is a generic makefile named
"Makefile.linux-gcc" in the top directory of the source tree that you
can copy and edit to suit your needs.  Comments on the generic makefile
show what changes are needed.

The linux binaries on the website are created using the generic makefile,
not the configure script.  The windows binaries on the website are created
using MinGW32 configured as a cross-compiler running under Linux.  For 
details, see the ./publish.sh script at the top-level of the source tree.
The developers do not use teh configure script.

SQLite does not require TCL to run, but a TCL installation is required
by the makefiles.  SQLite contains a lot of generated code and TCL is
used to do much of that code generation.  The makefile also requires
AWK.

Contacts:

  http://www.sqlite.org/
=======
    mkdir bld
    cd bld
    nmake /f Makefile.msc TOP=..\sqlite
    nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3.c TOP=..\sqlite
    nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3.dll TOP=..\sqlite
    nmake /f Makefile.msc sqlite3.exe TOP=..\sqlite
    nmake /f Makefile.msc test TOP=..\sqlite

There are several build options that can be set via the NMAKE command
line.  For example, to build for WinRT, simply add "FOR_WINRT=1" argument
to the "sqlite3.dll" command line above.  When debugging into the SQLite
code, adding the "DEBUG=1" argument to one of the above command lines is
recommended.

SQLite does not require [Tcl](http://www.tcl.tk/) to run, but a Tcl installation
is required by the makefiles (including those for MSVC).  SQLite contains
a lot of generated code and Tcl is used to do much of that code generation.
The makefiles also require AWK.

## Source Code Tour

Most of the core source files are in the **src/** subdirectory.  But
src/ also contains files used to build the "testfixture" test harness;
those file all begin with "test".  And src/ contains the "shell.c" file
which is the main program for the "sqlite3.exe" command-line shell and
the "tclsqlite.c" file which implements the bindings to SQLite from the
Tcl programming language.  (Historical note:  SQLite began as a Tcl
extension and only later escaped to the wild as an independent library.)

Test scripts and programs are found in the **test/** subdirectory.
There are other test suites for SQLite (see
[How SQLite Is Tested](http://www.sqlite.org/testing.html))
but those other test suites are
in separate source repositories.

The **ext/** subdirectory contains code for extensions.  The
Full-text search engine is in **ext/fts3**.  The R-Tree engine is in
**ext/rtree**.  The **ext/misc** subdirectory contains a number of
smaller, single-file extensions, such as a REGEXP operator.

The **tool/** subdirectory contains various scripts and programs used
for building generated source code files or for testing or for generating
accessory programs such as "sqlite3_analyzer(.exe)".

### Generated Source Code Files

Several of the C-language source files used by SQLite are generated from
other sources rather than being typed in manually by a programmer.  This
section will summarize those automatically-generated files.  To create all
of the automatically-generated files, simply run "make target&#95;source".
The "target&#95;source" make target will create a subdirectory "tsrc/" and
fill it with all the source files needed to build SQLite, both
manually-edited files and automatically-generated files.

The SQLite interface is defined by the **sqlite3.h** header file, which is
generated from src/sqlite.h.in, ./manifest.uuid, and ./VERSION.  The
[Tcl script](http://www.tcl.tk) at tool/mksqlite3h.tcl does the conversion.
The manifest.uuid file contains the SHA1 hash of the particular check-in
and is used to generate the SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID macro.  The VERSION file
contains the current SQLite version number.  The sqlite3.h header is really
just a copy of src/sqlite.h.in with the source-id and version number inserted
at just the right spots. Note that comment text in the sqlite3.h file is
used to generate much of the SQLite API documentation.  The Tcl scripts
used to generate that documentation are in a separate source repository.

The SQL language parser is **parse.c** which is generate from a grammar in
the src/parse.y file.  The conversion of "parse.y" into "parse.c" is done
by the [lemon](./doc/lemon.html) LALR(1) parser generator.  The source code
for lemon is at tool/lemon.c.  Lemon uses a
template for generating its parser.  A generic template is in tool/lempar.c,
but SQLite uses a slightly modified template found in src/lempar.c.

Lemon also generates the **parse.h** header file, at the same time it
generates parse.c. But the parse.h header file is
modified further (to add additional symbols) using the ./addopcodes.awk
AWK script.

The **opcodes.h** header file contains macros that define the numbers
corresponding to opcodes in the "VDBE" virtual machine.  The opcodes.h
file is generated by the scanning the src/vdbe.c source file.  The
AWK script at ./mkopcodeh.awk does this scan and generates opcodes.h.
A second AWK script, ./mkopcodec.awk, then scans opcodes.h to generate
the **opcodes.c** source file, which contains a reverse mapping from
opcode-number to opcode-name that is used for EXPLAIN output.

The **keywordhash.h** header file contains the definition of a hash table
that maps SQL language keywords (ex: "CREATE", "SELECT", "INDEX", etc.) into
the numeric codes used by the parse.c parser.  The keywordhash.h file is
generated by a C-language program at tool mkkeywordhash.c.

### The Amalgamation

All of the individual C source code and header files (both manually-edited
and automatically-generated) can be combined into a single big source file
**sqlite3.c** called "the amalgamation".  The amalgamation is the recommended
way of using SQLite in a larger application.  Combining all individual
source code files into a single big source code file allows the C compiler
to perform more cross-procedure analysis and generate better code.  SQLite
runs about 5% faster when compiled from the amalgamation versus when compiled
from individual source files.

The amalgamation is generated from the tool/mksqlite3c.tcl Tcl script.
First, all of the individual source files must be gathered into the tsrc/
subdirectory (using the equivalent of "make target_source") then the
tool/mksqlite3c.tcl script is run to copy them all together in just the
right order while resolving internal "#include" references.

The amalgamation source file is more than 100K lines long.  Some symbolic
debuggers (most notably MSVC) are unable to deal with files longer than 64K
lines.  To work around this, a separate Tcl script, tool/split-sqlite3c.tcl,
can be run on the amalgamation to break it up into a single small C file
called **sqlite3-all.c** that does #include on about five other files
named **sqlite3-1.c**, **sqlite3-2.c**, ..., **sqlite3-5.c**.  In this way,
all of the source code is contained within a single translation unit so
that the compiler can do extra cross-procedure optimization, but no
individual source file exceeds 32K lines in length.

## How It All Fits Together

SQLite is modular in design.
See the [architectural description](http://www.sqlite.org/arch.html)
for details. Other documents that are useful in
(helping to understand how SQLite works include the
[file format](http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html) description,
the [virtual machine](http://www.sqlite.org/vdbe.html) that runs
prepared statements, the description of
[how transactions work](http://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html), and
the [overview of the query planner](http://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html).

Unfortunately, years of effort have gone into optimizating SQLite, both
for small size and high performance.  And optimizations tend to result in
complex code.  So there is a lot of complexity in the SQLite implementation.

Key files:

  *  **sqlite3.h** - This file defines the public interface to the SQLite
     library.  Readers will need to be familiar with this interface before
     trying to understand how the library works internally.

  *  **sqliteInt.h** - this header file defines many of the data objects
     used internally by SQLite.

  *  **parse.y** - This file describes the LALR(1) grammer that SQLite uses
     to parse SQL statements, and the actions that are taken at each stop
     in the parsing process.

  *  **vdbe.c** - This file implements the virtual machine that runs
     prepared statements.  There are various helper files whose names
     begin with "vdbe".  The VDBE has access to the vdbeInt.h header file
     which defines internal data objects.  The rest of SQLite interacts
     with the VDBE through an interface defined by vdbe.h.

  *  **where.c** - This file analyzes the WHERE clause and generates
     virtual machine code to run queries efficiently.  This file is
     sometimes called the "query optimizer".  It has its own private
     header file, whereInt.h, that defines data objects used internally.

  *  **btree.c** - This file contains the implementation of the B-Tree
     storage engine used by SQLite.

  *  **pager.c** - This file contains the "pager" implementation, the
     module that implements transactions.

  *  **os_unix.c** and **os_win.c** - These two files implement the interface
     between SQLite and the underlying operating system using the run-time
     pluggable VFS interface.
