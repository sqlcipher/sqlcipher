# This file implements regression tests for SQLite library.  The
# focus of this script is testing code cipher features.
#
# NOTE: tester.tcl has overridden the definition of sqlite3 to 
# automatically pass in a key value. Thus tests in this file
# should explicitly close and open db with sqlite_orig in order
# to bypass default key assignment.
